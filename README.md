## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Sentiment classification using machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of sentiment distribution

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```
