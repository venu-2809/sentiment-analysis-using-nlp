# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is focused on building a sentiment analysis model to classify text data into positive, negative sentiments. The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and interpret the sentiment of textual data.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Sentiment classification using machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of sentiment distribution

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```

## Usage
To run the sentiment analysis model, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input data/input.txt --output results/output.txt
```
